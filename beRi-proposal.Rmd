# Preface

Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of science advancement according to the [NIH](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility). Given R's increasing popularity in biotech and research as well as the aims of rOpenSci, there is a great need to provide frameworks or tools that seek to improve reproducibility and offer R users more comprehensive and easier options to achieve reproducibility. Currently, there are a number of R packages that seek to improve reproducibility. The [containerit](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) projects are examples that incorporate containerization via docker. However, many R users in biotech and research (specifically academic environments) don't typically have access to docker given it's a newer technology, it's not widely adopted by academic institutions due to potential system [vulnerabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface), and it typically requires administrative privileges. In these types of situations, [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language/) is  a preferred framwork and by far one of the most popular options for reproducibility.  In other cases, users to different R packages including [packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat), [checkpoint](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint)(MRAN), [miniCRAN](https://github.com/andrie/miniCRAN), [drat](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat), [workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr), and [rbundler](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbundler/index.html) for reproducibility.  While these packages have tremendous value to R users, they limit users to using an interactive R session (the R shell).

# Scope 

## Comparing Programming Languages

Many of the popular programming languages in the bioinformatics community have a command-line package manager that offers access to a standard or customizable package repository.  Python has [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), Javascript has the [npm-client](https://github.com/npm/cli) and [npm-registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry), and Ruby has the [gem-client](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) for [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/).  R has [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), which are package repositories, but R doesn't have an easy (as compared to pip or npm) way to install packages globally or locally via the command-line. Improving the management of R package installation and removal could boost reproducibility for projects and boost the userbase by offering an option specifically for the bioinformatics community.

In addition to package management, it is often important for R users to install R from source.  HPC systems generally need R installed from source because system admins desire specific global configurations.   More specifically, HPC system users need to install R in locally order to utilize a specific version of R (or a package that depends on a specific R vversion) or to have a custom configuration of R in their environment.  Other programming languages including Python ([pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)) and Ruby ([rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) and [ruby-build](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)) have third-party interfaces that manage the installation and management of various versions of the language which aids in the reproducibility of an environment for project as well as localization of a project's dependencies.

With these ideas in mind, we propose [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi), a suite of tools for managing R.  beRi will depend on three independent tools that work towards providing new options for managing R virtual environments, R package management, R installation management, and other R utilities all from the command line.  beRi will be built on top of this toolset, and provide a more hollistic experience by adding project management and configuration.

## Comparing R Workflows

As a well-developed language, R is loved and used by a diverse group of individuals and is [rising in popularity](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/popularity/) for a variety of reasons.  R is trafficked, most notably, by individuals from the healthcare industry, academic institutions, and government entities as seen by a recent stackoverflow analysis:
  
```{r fig.width = 2, fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("data/stackof_R_industry_growth.png")
```

Bioinformatics professionals are incorporated into all of the top 3 categories.  In fact, the bioinformatician is our target audience for the beRi suite of tools.  Other interested parties include researchers in basic or clinical sciences, biologists, clinicians, data scientists, data analysts, system administrators, HPC system users, R package developers, and lovers of the command line.  beRi will also appeal to new users of R who are used to Python and/or command line interfaces.  While the current workflow options allow R users to successfully perform analyses and manage projects, a good sign of a healthy programming ecosystem is the availability of multiple solutions to the same problem.  The most popular options remain to be conda/bioconda, packrat/jetpack, and docker (rocker/containerit) respectively.

Docker seems to be a very hollistic solution as containerizations produces an exact replicate of your project's environment at the operating system level.  The issue with docker is that there are a limited number of individuals in academia and the healthcare industry who can utilize this technology.  RStudio's packrat solution is also a great tool, but packrat builds for large projects can be increadibly slow.  Anaconda's ecosystem for R is not only a tool that is most similar to our approach, but has also been the leading question when we have proposed beRi in informal settings like reddit:

> "How does this differ from conda?"
> "What are the benefits of using beRi over conda?"

A more detailed comparison of beRi and conda (along with other popular tools) can be seen in the table below.  The main benefit and goal of beRi is to connect users directly to the R ecosystem (CRAN, Bioconductor, MRAN, GitHub, etc.), and provide a means for micromanaging the R environment in one toolset.  While conda accomplishes some of the same goals, the CLI is inevitably attached to anaonda's repositories.

 <!-- Insert Table -->

In this context beRi is not meant to replace existing tools, but to incorporate another toolset into the R ecosystem.  We would like to provide alternative workflows as well as new technologies for the R programming language that could help grow and maintain the R community at large.  

# The Plan

# The Team

Our team consists of several "tiers" of individuals based on experience level and willingness to contribute in the long term.  In the short term we are using the terms "Projecet Manager", "Lead Maintainer", and "Contributor" to manage our responsibilities.  The beRi team will develop under the [DataSnakes](https://github.com/datasnakes) organization on GitHub.  All of the current contributors participated in developing beRi at the Hackseq 2018 bioinformatics hackathon in Vancouver, BC.  Team beRi walked away from the hackathon as [winners](https://www.hackseq.com/) by popular vote after developing compelling demos of the command line tools.

## Project Manager

beRi was originally concieved by [Rob Gilmore](https://www.linkedin.com/in/robert-gilmore-7b451592).  At Hackseq 2018 his leadership skills and projecet management experience guided Team beRi to success as the winners of the hackathon.  Gilmore's skillsets are derived from his education in [Biomedical Engineering](https://www.abe.msstate.edu/academics/undergraduate/biomedical-engineering/curriculum/) at Mississippi State University, professional development at [Engineering Research and Development Center](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/), and extensive Bioinformatics experience as a Researcher in the fields of Genetics and Psychiatry using non-human primate models.  In his current position at the [University of Mississippi Medical Center](https://www.umc.edu/som/Departments%20and%20Offices/SOM%20Departments/Psychiatry-and-Human-Behavior/Centers/Divisions,%20Centers,%20Divisions%20and%20Research/Neurobiology-and-Behavior-Research/Overview.html) he has utilized the [Mississippi Center for Computational Research's](https://mcsr.olemiss.edu/research/) HPC system to manage and develop large scale bioinformatics pipelines using Linux, Windows, Python, R, and bash.
