# Summary

  The R community is composed of various types of people who use R in different ways.  However, one of the biggest themes amongst R users across various scientific disciplines is the idea of reproducible research.  "Containerization" via docker has become a necessary means to make an R project reproducible.  The [containerit](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and [rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) projects are both great examples stemming from the usefulness of containerization.  However, R users don't alwasy have the means to utilize docker containers for R.  This can be particullarly true in academic settings where system administrators are under heavy workload and/or are hesitant to utilize a technology that could render the system [vulnerable](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface).  In these types of situations many people turn to [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language/) as a means of generating reproducible projects.  Other workflows involve the use of R packages including [packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat), [checkpoint](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint) (MRAN), [miniCRAN](https://github.com/andrie/miniCRAN), [drat](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat), and [rbundler](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rbundler/index.html).  While these tools have their use cases, they limit users to interactive R (the R shell).
