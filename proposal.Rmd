# Preface

Reproducibility is one of the cornerstones of scientific advancement according to the
[NIH](https://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility).  Organizations such as RStudio and rOpenSci
promote these values, which makes R based data analysis increasingly more attractive.  This is especially true in
academia and in the health care industry, where R's popularity has created a demand for easy to use tools that
improve reproducible research. Currently, several technologies exist that seek to accomplish this
goal.  The [containerit](https://github.com/o2r-project/containerit) and
[rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org/rocker) projects are examples that incorporate containerization via docker.
The Docker strategy is a way to perfectly reproduce a project on any system.  However, many R users in academia
and in the health care industry usually don't have access to docker, primarily because of
system [vulnerabilities](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface), and
because it typically requires administrative privileges. In these types of situations,
[conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/use-r-language/) is the preferred framework
and is by far one of the most popular options for reproducibility.  In other use cases, researchers also prefer
various R packages including [packrat](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat),
[checkpoint](https://github.com/RevolutionAnalytics/checkpoint) (MRAN),
[miniCRAN](https://github.com/andrie/miniCRAN), [drat](https://github.com/eddelbuettel/drat),
[workflowr](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr), and
[drake](https://github.com/ropensci/drake).  While these packages
add tremendous value to data analysis projects, they limit users to using an interactive R session (the R shell).

# Scope

## Comparing Programming Languages

Many popular programming languages in the bioinformatics community have a command-line package manager that
offers access to a standard or custom package repository.  Python for example has
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) for [PyPi](https://pypi.org/), and [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) for
[Anaconda Cloud](https://anaconda.org/).  JavaScript has the [npm-client](https://github.com/npm/cli) for the
[npm-registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/registry).  And Ruby has the
[gem-client](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems) for [RubyGems.org](https://rubygems.org/).  While R has
[CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/), it doesn't have a way to install packages globally or locally via the command-line.

In addition to package management, it is often important for researchers to install various software in their
local environment.  HPC systems for instance are more likely to not have a required piece of software, to have
fewer choices for different versions of software, or to have the software configured inappropriately for the
user's needs.  This is especially true for programming languages that frequently receive updates to their source
code.  To alleviate this Python and Ruby have third-party interfaces
([pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv), [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv), and
[ruby-build](https://github.com/jdblischak/workflowr)) that manage the installation and management of various
versions of the programming language.  While [conda](https://conda.io/docs/) can manage R installations, it cannot manage the various version of the language it installs.

## Comparing R Workflows

Currently, many workflow options exist that allow R users to manage environments to some degree.
However, our experience with them always left us wanting more, whether that was speed, flexibility, or convenient command-line usage.
The most popular options are Docker (rocker/containerit), packrat, and conda.
Docker offers containerization that results in exact replicates of your environment including the operating system.
The primary barriers for Docker are its complexity and its requirement for administrative privileges, which stunt its adoption in settings where time is limited for users and/or system administrators (*e.g.* academia).
While packrat is an excellent tool for for maintaining isolated, portable and reproducible environments for each project, it becomes intractably slow when projects grow in complexity, measured here as the number of package dependencies.
Anaconda's ecosystem for R is most similar to our approach, which has been the main subject of debate in the [r/rstats](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/) Reddit and #rstats Twitter communities:

> "How does this differ from conda?"  
> "What are the benefits of using beRi over conda?"

## Comparing beRi and Conda

Without further ado, we propose [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi), a toolset for managing R installations, R packages, and R environments.
Following the [UNIX philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy), we plan to divide these three goals into three modular packages, namely rinse, rut, and renv, respectively.
These packages will form the basis for beRi, which will leverage their functionality and provide a unified and user-friendly experience for configuring R environments.

First of all, CRAN or Bioconductor R packages need to be adapted for
Anaconda Cloud in order to be installable via conda.
At the time of writing, one [list](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/r-language-pkg-docs/) of R packages on Anaconda Cloud counted 328 packages, which represents a small fraction of [CRAN](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/index.html)'s 13,285 packages.
We do not see the need to reimplement excellent repositories such as CRAN or Bioconductor.
We simply wish to expose a practical, intuitive, and convenient command-line interface for installing packages from CRAN, Bioconductor and other sources (*e.g.* MRAN, GitHub) and managing R environments.
Additionally, we have had several issues when installing R packages using the `install.packages()` function with an R installation managed through conda.
This often leads to compilation errors and library conflicts that are hard to resolve.
We found that maintaining a local installation of R eliminates these issues.
Thus, while conda is beginning to offer what we seek for R, it falls short due to the above issues.

## Target audience

R is a popular data science language, especially in the academic and healthcare sectors.[@Robinson2017-xv] Our target audience are those who can immediately benefit from better environment manangement in R, including computational researchers, data scientists, system administrators, and R package developers.
By design, beRi will also appeal to new R users who come from Python and/or have experience using the command line.
We realize that a command-line tool is not accessible to most R users.
That being said, we believe that R users who informed about software environments are much more likely to know how to use the command line.

## What beRi is not

Unlike conda and Anaconda Cloud, we do not aim to implement a dependency resolution system, nor do we wish to replicate existing repositories.
We plan on leveraging the existing facilities in R for installing packages from repositories such as CRAN and Bioconductor.

# The Team

[Team-beRi](https://github.com/orgs/datasnakes/teams/team-beri) is a group of individuals who are passionate about reproducibility in science but have experienced the limitations of existing tools.
Bridging that gap was the motivation for prototyping beRi at [hackseq18](https://www.hackseq.com/) and winning the popular votes exhibits that there is a strong interest and need for this tool in at least the bioinformatics community.

We are familiar with Python, R, and Bash from our daily work and plan to use these languages as the building blocks of the project.
Some of us have software engineering experience to help with the development process.
Since we will be both makers and users of this tool and are surrounded by fellow R users in science, we can continually improve beRi by adapting frequent feedback from ourselves and our community, who will be the end users of beRi.

Our team is divided into "tiers" of individuals based on experience level and willingness to contribute in the long term.
We are using the terms "Project Manager", "Lead Maintainer", and "Contributor" to manage our responsibilities.
The beRi team will develop under the [DataSnakes](https://github.com/datasnakes) organization on GitHub.
All of the current contributors participated in developing beRi at the
Hackseq 2018 bioinformatics hackathon in Vancouver, BC, Canada.

    He dreams of publishing a Git repository that can reproduce every analysis from his thesis with a single command.
    beRi plays an important role in helping him achieve that goal.

# The Plan

beRi is a suite of Python packages which is composed of a virtual environment manager for R ([renv](https://github.com/datasnakes/renv)), an R installation and R version manager ([rinse](https://github.com/datasnakes/rinse)), and an R utility tool for installing packages, managing native R configuration files, and setting up local CRAN-like repositories ([rut](https://github.com/datasnakes/rut)).
These packages will be developed in separate repositories as standalone or fully independent CLI's, and [beRi](https://github.com/datasnakes/beRi) will also be developed in a separate repository.
However, the beRi CLI will depend on the other three packages, which will provide an enhanced and comprehensive experience as well as project management.

To begin, these packages will be built with Python for Linux systems starting with the latest Ubuntu release with long-term.
We will optimize our Python packages for the R ecosystem by using the [R manuals](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/), which can be found on the CRAN website.
Following stable builds, we will test under various
Linux distributions, followed by Windows 7 and above, and finally, macOS systems.
These Python packages are currently being managed by [poetry](https://github.com/sdispater/poetry) for ease of use and intuitive workflow; however, we have also considered switching to [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) in the future if poetry does not satisfy our needs. [click](https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/) will be used to build the command line interface.

## Standalone CLI - renv

renv, short for R virtual environment, is a Python-style virtual environment package for R.
It will use Python's venv [EnvBuilder](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/3.6/Lib/venv/__init__.py#L17) module along with [cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) in order to deploy the proper shell scripts (activate) and R configuration files (.Rprofile, .Renviron).
A directory will be utilized in the users home directory (`~/.renv`) as a repository for any environment created.
The environments created with renv will not only be configurable with the .Rprofile/.Renviron files, but also a custom renv.yaml config file located in the root of the environment directory (`~/.renv/<env-name>/renv.yaml`).
This file will also allow the user to set up default environment variables, CRAN mirrors, and to set default packages to install.
The renv CLI will also contain a default yaml file for all newly created environments.

## Standalone CLI - rinse

rinse, short for R installer, is currently a simple installer for the latest version of R.
In the future, we would like to implement features similar to [pyvenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/blob/master/COMMANDS.md).
This includes installing/uninstalling R from source, managing some of R's dependencies, and switching in between version of R.
Installing
Microsoft R-Open or [other R implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)#Implementations) will also be considered.
After Linux development is stable, a long-term goal is to provide for the installation of Rtools on Windows.

## Standalone CLI - rut

rut, short for R utilities, will be an R package manager that will also be able to set up local CRAN-like repositories and manage custom R configuration files such as .Rprofile and .Renviron.
In its current iteration, rut can install packages from CRAN using R's remotes package.
As the least developed package and likely the most difficult to implement, rut will require more attention in order to develop it with best practices and effectively integrate it with beRi.
With regards to rut, we have discussed wrapping the R CMD INSTALL command, integrating a simpler version of [jetpack](https://github.com/ankane/jetpack), or utilizing [rpy2](https://rpy2.readthedocs.io/en/version_2.8.x/) for getting interpreter specific information.

## Integrated CLI - beRi


The primary and initial goal for the beRi suite of tools was to create standalone packages.
We looked to other programming languages for inspiration and R manuals and various documentations to keep the R ecosystem and R community in mind.
The integration of the three tools under the beRi CLI will help us develop a custom project workflow with one cohesive interface.
Once the standalone tools are functional, we will develop an analogous YAML configuration workflow for each package so that we can configure our environment with one YAML file and develop a beRi file-system.
The `~/.beRi` folder, for instance, will contain any renv environments, R installations, CRAN-like repositories, and `.libPaths()` associated with beRi processes by default.
While the development of beRi will affect some of the changes we make to the standalone CLI, we will never limit renv, rinse, or rut by linking them to each other or to beRi.

# Project Milestones

The planning phase of this project requires a continuous effort. [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/blog/how-to-use-github-agile-project-management/), which integrates with GitHub, provides agile project management that will help contributors understand the project from a hierarchical view.
Using ZenHub Milestones, Estimates, Epics, and Pipelines will help us generate timelines based on criteria such as difficulty, stage of development, and the priority level of various tasks. [Todoist](https://todoist.com/tour) will be used for general task management. [Slack](https://slackdemo.com/?cvosrc=ppc.google.d_ppc_google_sitelink-slack-demo&cvo_creative=257483843273&utm_medium=ppc&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=d_ppc_google_sitelink-slack-demo&utm_term=slack&gclid=CjwKCAjwvNXeBRAjEiwAjqYhFklAL-7zPDBj92XOJ0hUoyRYdLL8cJIa_xaP8NtVsfb-cWKoU0IRbxoCNN8QAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) will be another interface for higher level discussion and communication between collaborators and users of beRi.
