## Help Us Improve BeRi

Please feel free to provide feedback about this project by [opening an issue](https://github.com/datasnakes/beri-isc-proposal/issues/new). We want this project to cater to the greater R community and specifically to those who are invested in [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) and [rstats](https://www.reddit.com/r/rstats/).
